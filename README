# 🚀 SprintSync CLI

A Minimalist Agile Project Management Tool for Dev Teams

SprintSync is a robust, object-oriented Command-Line Interface (CLI) designed for startup teams to manage projects, track tasks, and maintain productivity. Built with Python 3.10+, it features persistent storage, secure authentication, and a clean interactive UI.

## 📋 Features

- **Secure Authentication**: Password hashing using hashlib and role-based access control (Admin vs. User)
- **Project Management**: Create, view, and track high-level project containers
- **Task Tracking**: Granular task management with status toggles (Todo/Done)
- **Persistent Storage**: All data is saved across sessions using organized JSON structures
- **Beautiful CLI**: High-readability tables and status indicators powered by the Rich library

## 🏗️ Architecture & OOP Principles

SprintSync is built on solid Object-Oriented foundations:

### Class Hierarchy (Inheritance)

- **Person** (Base Class): Defines core identity attributes (name, email)
- **User** (Subclass): Inherits from Person; adds password_hash, role (Admin/Dev), and user_id
- **Project**: Manages a collection of tasks
- **Task**: Individual units of work assigned to specific User IDs

### Encapsulation & Logic

- **Decorators**: Used for `@property` getters/setters and `@require_auth` to protect sensitive commands
- **Validation**: Input handling to ensure due dates and emails follow correct formats

🤝 Team Collaboration (Git Workflow)
We follow a strict feature-branch workflow to ensure code quality:

Branching: No direct commits to main. Branches are named feat/feature-name or fix/issue-name.

Tracking: Tasks are managed via [Insert Tool Name: e.g., Trello/Jira].

Review: All code is reviewed by at least one teammate before merging.
